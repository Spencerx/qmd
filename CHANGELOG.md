Initial public release.

### Features

- **Hybrid search pipeline** — BM25 full-text + vector similarity + LLM reranking with Reciprocal Rank Fusion

- **Cross-encoder reranking** — Qwen3-Reranker scores candidates with position-aware blending
- **Vector embeddings** — EmbeddingGemma 300M via node-llama-cpp, all on-device
- **MCP server** — stdio and HTTP transports for Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and any MCP client
- **Collection management** — index multiple directories with glob patterns
- **Context annotations** — add descriptions to collections and paths for richer search
- **Document IDs** — 6-char content hash for stable references across re-indexes
- **Multi-get** — retrieve multiple documents by glob pattern, comma list, or docids
- **Multiple output formats** — JSON, CSV, Markdown, XML, files list
- **Claude Code plugin** — inline status checks and MCP integration

### Fixes
